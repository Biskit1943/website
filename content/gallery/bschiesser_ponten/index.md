Parking 5 Euro per day.

Unfortunately we didn't made the whole tour due to some knee issues.
You need a lot of endurance for that tour!

Note, that the signs to the Bschießer summit lead through another path, you
need to follow the komoot tour!

If you're not that fit, you could use the cable car to get up. If for some
reason (like our knee issues) you wan't to go earlier, use any of the paths
down, the signs (or komoot) should lead you the way.
